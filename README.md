# Predicting users’ personality trait based groups and users’ recommendation
This research employs statistical and machine learn-
ing techniques to analyze a dataset of Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) categories and Big Five personality scores.
Through hypothesis testing, we identified significant gender
differences in certain personality traits. Pearson correlation
analysis suggested a lack of significant relationship between
anxiety-related words and security. We applied various ma-
chine learning models, including multinomial logistic regression,
K-means clustering, and Recurrent Neural Network, yielding
promising results in personality prediction. The study offers
valuable insights that can be leveraged for team optimization and
career counseling, underscoring the potential of computational
methods in psychological research
